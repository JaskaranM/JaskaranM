Problem solving and multidisciplinary talent is at the forefront of my adaptive problem solving skills that I hone and sharpen on a daily basis whilst studying computer science at Aston University
## Objective
My journey in computer science from a young age has led to my profound interest in the variety of sectors. As I ventured down this path further, I found my passion for cybersecurity and have taken great interest in this ever-changing digital environment that is the backbone of society. My objective and goal is to enter the cybersecurity field into roles such as cybersecurity engineer, analyst or penetration tester.
